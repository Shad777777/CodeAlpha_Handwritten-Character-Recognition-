# ✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR)

## 📌 Objective
Identify handwritten characters or alphabets from image datasets.

## 🔬 Approach
We use **image processing** and **deep learning techniques** to classify handwritten digits and characters.  

The project is built around **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which are well-suited for recognizing patterns in images.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Input: Handwritten characters/digits as images
- ✅ Dataset options:
  - MNIST (digits 0–9)
  - EMNIST (characters A–Z)
- ✅ Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- ✅ Extendable to:
  - Full word recognition
  - Sentence recognition using **CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)**
- ✅ Includes preprocessing (grayscale, normalization, reshaping)
- ✅ Training, evaluation, and accuracy comparison

📊 Example Results

MNIST Digit Recognition Accuracy: ~99%
EMNIST Character Recognition Accuracy: ~90–95
(Results may vary depending on hyperparameters and training time.)
📌 Future Work
Improve accuracy with deeper CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet)
Sequence modeling for full handwriting recognition (CRNN, LSTM)
Deploy trained model as a web app using Flask/Streamlit

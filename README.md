✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR)
deep learning–based project to identify handwritten characters and digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
This project demonstrates how image processing and neural networks
can be applied to solve OCR (Optical Character Recognition) problems


🚀 Overview

Objective: Identify handwritten characters (digits and alphabets) from images.

Approach:
Image preprocessing (normalization, resizing, augmentation)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification
Option to switch dataset between MNIST (digits) and EMNIST (characters)
Extendable to sequence recognition (CRNN / CTC) for words or sentences

Use cases
OCR for forms and exams
Handwritten digit/character classification for education apps
Preprocessing stage for handwriting-to-text conversion systems



✨ Features
✅ Train and Evaluate Models
 Build and train a CNN classifier for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST).
 Extend to character recognition using EMNIST.
✅ Computer Vision Preprocessing Pipeline
 Normalize and resize input images.
 Apply data augmentation (rotation, shift, noise) to improve generalization.
✅ Model Management
 Save and load models in TensorFlow and PyTorch formats.
 Reuse trained models for inference or fine-tuning.
✅ Experimentation & Visualization
  Interactive Jupyter notebooks for EDA, training, and result visualization.
✅ Inference on New Images
   Example script (inference.py) to predict handwritten digits/characters from uploaded images.
✅ Extend to Sequence Recognition
Instructions to expand from character-level CNN to CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) for full word or sentence recognition.

🧠 Model (example)

A simple CNN architecture used in src/model.py:
Input: 28×28 grayscale image
Conv2D(32) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
Conv2D(64) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
Flatten -> Dense(128) -> Dropout -> Dense(num_classes) -> Softmax
